## Kali Linux (Quick Notes)

### What is it?
- A Linux distro made for cybersecurity tasks like hacking, scanning, and forensics.
- Built on Debian, comes with tons of preinstalled security tools.

### Why Kali?
- Saves setup time â€” tools are already installed and configured.
- It's used in CTFs, pentesting labs, and by real-world security professionals.
- Helps me learn and practice hacking in a real environment.

### Useful tools it comes with
nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Hydra, Metasploit, Gobuster, Dirb, John the Ripper, hashcat, sqlmap, netcat, aircrack-ng

### My Experience
- Downloaded as a VM on my Mac using UTM (VirtualBox not great for ARM). 
- Must download the ARM image (snapshot of the OS that can be run on UTM) to work since M3 is ARM not x86.
- No need to download desktop seperately, but might need to add "serial" to settings when booting up for installation, as otherwise can't access terminal (again only for installation).
