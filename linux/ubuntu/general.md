## Ubuntu (Quick Notes)

### What is it?
- A user-friendly Linux distro based on Debian.
- Commonly used for development, servers, and everyday use.

### Why am I using it?
- Acts as defender machine in my homelab setup.
- Lets me simulate real-world targets for testing attacks.
- Easier to navigate than Kali for basic tasks and setup.

### Useful packages/tools it comes with
gnome-terminal, apt, ufw, net-tools, ssh, curl, git, python3, gcc

### My Experience
- Downloaded on UTM using the ARM image.
- Must run a few updates then download ubuntu desktop seperately (takes a while).
- Takes longer to boot up than Kali.
